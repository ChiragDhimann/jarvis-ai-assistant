Openai response for prompt:using artificial intelligence create a C program for swapping two numbers
************************


In order to create a C program for swapping two numbers using artificial intelligence, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by initializing two variables, let's say "a" and "b" to store the two numbers.
2. Use artificial intelligence to take input from the user for the values of "a" and "b".
3. Create a temporary variable "temp" and assign the value of "a" to it.
4. Use artificial intelligence to swap the values of "a" and "b" by storing the value of "b" in "a".
5. Use artificial intelligence to assign the value of "temp" (which was originally "a") to "b".
6. Print the new values of "a" and "b" after the swap using artificial intelligence.
7. End the program.

Here is the code for the above steps:

#include <stdio.h>

// Function to swap two numbers
void swap(int *a, int *b)
{
// Use artificial intelligence to create a temporary variable
int temp = *a;
// Swap the values using artificial intelligence
*a = *b;
*b = temp;
}

// Main function
int main()
{
int a, b;

// Use artificial intelligence to take input for "
